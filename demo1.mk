# Install by copying (or symlinking) makefiles into a directory

# chdir to that location.

# Call via:
# `make -f WORKFLOW-CONFIG.mk WORKSPACE-DIRS` or
# `make -f WORKFLOW-CONFIG.mk all` or just
# `make -f WORKFLOW-CONFIG.mk`
# To rebuild partially, you must pass -W to recursive make:
# `make -f WORKFLOW-CONFIG.mk EXTRA_MAKEFLAGS="-W FILEGRP"`
# To get help on available goals:
# `make help`
